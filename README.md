#  Team Expense Tracker

This project was created with [Rajkumar](https://github.com/thisisrajkumar).

 I got the idea of developing this application while we went for trip to varkala as friends,  there we beared our expenses together for our food and stay. Later, we thought to share the money among us but at that moment we felt the difficulty of doing the calculation. During that instant I got the idea of making this application. 

## How to use this application 

 Now, let me explain the usage of the application.Through this application you can enter the amount which you spent and it will give the result , the total amount that you ought to recive from another person and also the total amount you have to pay to another person. Through this app the calculation will become easy .

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
